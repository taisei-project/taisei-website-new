                This is a little collection of in-game screenshots.
                They range back from the very beginnings of the projects to today.
                As you can see, some progress has been made. ;)
            </p>
            <p>
                There is much more to see, but we wonâ€™t reveal it all in this
                section. So go play the game yourself and explore the different
                levels, bosses and most importantly: The bullet patterns!</p>

                <div class="a_content"><p>Unless you've been closely following Taisei on our Discord or GitHub, it may seem like Taisei is mostly &quot;finished&quot; (or perhaps &quot;abandoned&quot;) from a development perspective. But nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
<p>While we've recently put out a new maintenance release of v1.3.2 which strictly covered some critical bugs that were reported, we've been busy at work for the past year and a half to bring you v1.4. Here's some of the new features we're planning for this upcoming version, which we're hoping to release by the end of the year:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A <strong>rewritten coroutines engine called `koishi`</strong> which greatly enhances the ability to write and script the behaviour of player shots, enemy movement, danmaku patterns, and background rendering. With this, we have rewritten:<ul>
<li>All 6 stages from the ground up.</li>
<li>All character shots.</li>
<li>All enemy movements and behaviours.</li>
<li>The dialogue system.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>new story and script</strong>, including:<ul>
<li>New story concept written by Alice D.</li>
<li>An Extra stage boss concept, with music composed by Jneen Collective.</li>
<li>New cutscenes and character art drawn by Afensorm.</li>
<li>New background models for stage 3, 4, 5, and 6 by Akari and laochailan.</li>
<li>New and improved fairy sprites by Akari.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Many, many <strong>small bugs and annoyances fixed</strong>, including things like sluggish movement on MarisaA's lasers.</li>
<li>New <strong>automatic testing builds, releases, and publishing</strong> through GitHub Actions for all supported platforms.</li>
<li>Alpha support for Apple Silicon (M1).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's what's remaining until we feel like v1.4 would be ready to go:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Finishing some boss logic remastering for stages 3, 4, 6.</li>
<li>Completing the new Extra stage.</li>
<li>Fixing up some remaining internals (such as the Boss Attack code) so they make more sense.</li>
<li>Balancing the difficulty curve.</li>
<li>Lots and lots of QA.</li>
</ul>
<p>As the old saying goes, &quot;it'll be ready when it's done,&quot; but at our current pace, we're pretty optimistic we'll have a beta out sometime mid-fall.</p>

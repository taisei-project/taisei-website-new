            <div class="a_content">
                <p>Hey, we are back for a little replay-compatible update to the 1.3 release. The changes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Improved laser rendering and other visual improvements</strong>. The spell card opener looks yet a bit cooler, there are little indicators for off-screen items.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Player Spell Cards</strong> now have proper names and declaration animations.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Optimizations</strong> in various shaders that will make your toaster a bit happier about running Taisei. However, as usual, it is best if your toaster has good OpenGL drivers to avoid most trouble.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The audio assets are now in <strong>Opus</strong> format, which reduces file size at increased fidelity. On that note, the file sizes in general have been reduced, which benefits the loading time of the web version of Taisei.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Quite a few <strong>bug fixes</strong>. Of particular importance, two potentially game-breaking bugs have been vanquished:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In Cirno's very first spell “Perfect Freeze”, the player could (extremely rarely) get killed for no apparent reason. This was caused by a bug in bullet motion interpolation.</li>
<li>In some builds, MarisaA's lasers would render enemies permanently invulnerable, making them ineffective weapons to put it lightly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But we actually have a big ace up our bullet riddled sleeves as well:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Complete replacement of the <strong>character artwork</strong> by <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/afensorm">&#64;afensorm</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>They are cute, they are colorful and if you look carefully, some parts glow a bit. We also have some variable facial expressions incoming, but those will be part of version 1.4.</p>
<p>We are happy to also announce the new Switch homebrew port by <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/p__sam">&#64;p-sam</a>. Now you can clear <em>Tower of Truth “Theory of Everything”</em> on public transport and impress your fellow passenger!</p>

            <div class="a_content">
                <p>After quite some time we are back with another release! The list of changes is a bit more subtle than in the last releases.</p>
<p>The short story of it is that with deep-reaching engine optimizations we were able to get better performance… which we used</p>
<p>to make the game look significantly better in many places. You can now enjoy high resolution graphics and about an infinite amount of particles spraying around.</p>
<p>The new graphics backend is maybe almost too flexible. Akari was able to whip up an (emscripten-powered) browser version of Taisei in a bunch of days.</p>
<p>This is still experimental, but you can try to <a class="reference external" href="https://taisei-project.org/play">play it on the web</a> now like it’s really 2019!</p>
<p>But of course we also have some gameplay changes for you!</p>
<p>Here is a very coarse list of notable changes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Greatly improved Graphics</strong>. Name one thing you knew in Taisei and chances are, it looks much better now compared to v1.2. In case we made your intel laptop blush (or get a fever), find the new quality settings in the options.</li>
<li><strong>Reimu</strong> is now finally investigating this incident. Fans will be able to use her traditional homing shot and blasting orb bomb. Moreover, her second shot will have you bend space to reach all the places elusive to the regular household shots. But let’s face the real reason she’s in the game: Developer favoritism.</li>
<li><strong>Scoring System</strong>s are a staple in danmaku games and now Taisei too has a nontrivial mechanic that transforms the way you route your stages. You can activate <em>Power Surges</em> that reward you in points and resources which makes this feature fun for both skilled scorers and the average Yōkai. The spells formerly known as <em>Extra Spells</em> are now <em>Voltage Overdrives</em> and are unlocked using the surges.</li>
<li><strong>New MarisaB</strong>. Marisa always had a rather slow second shotmode which got replaced by her new <em>Stellar Vortex</em>. This is still an inverted focus, but releases a whole storm of bullets that will flush those fairies off the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Music Room</strong>. Unlock and listen to every piece of our <a class="reference external" href="https://tuckv.bandcamp.com/album/taisei-project-ost">cool soundtrack</a>. There are two bonus tracks that are unlocked under special circumstances. Can you find them?</li>
<li><strong>Bombs</strong> are now more unique and require different strategies to maximize their damage.</li>
<li><strong>Modified Collision Formulas</strong>. Oh well we had some bugs in the old ones and never realized… :'))) But this change is probably less noticeable to most players.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern changes</strong>. We did not touch the bullets much, but in a few select places we improved patterns slightly.</li>
</ul>
<p>As always it is difficult to put over a year of development in such a short list especially since most of the work this time was behind the scenes. In lines of code we had around 57000 insertions and 20000 deletions since v1.2 which is quite the magnitude for a small project like ours. It's a little sad that we don't get to brag about all the internal engine changes in excruciating detail, but such is life … ;)</p>
<p>Special Thanks this time go to Akari whose hard work and creativity made 95% of this release. We would also like to thank our testers which were more than essential in the making of the scoring system and performance testing on all kinds of different hardware. Thanks to the all people who contributed over the last year, those who left the team and those who joined. And last but not least to you there following the Taisei news after all this time.</p>

                <p>A hearty welcome to all those watching our website with bated breaths, for today marks a grand milestone in the annals of Taisei Project. Although perhaps not apparent to the public eye, the team has expanded significantly over the course of several months to include a composer, a writer, an artist, and several dedicated playtesters. Thus, while the developers have still been busy upgrading and tweaking gameplay, the addition of these new members has allowed for new improvements that they would have been unable to create on their own.</p>
<p>Notable changes include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://tuckv.bandcamp.com/album/taisei-project-ost">An original soundtrack</a> for every completed stage and boss fight in the game, as well as for the menu, ending, and credits screens. This was done entirely by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw73cuHLnFCSpjOtt_9pyg">Tuck V</a>, a Western ZUN-style composer.</li>
<li><strong>All-new sound effects</strong> for bullets and shot types, which in tandem with the music greatly reduce the silence in the game. They also reflect which bullet type aligns with them, resulting in the necessary warning system people have come to expect from shmups. Most of these are by <a class="reference external" href="https://vnutriya.bandcamp.com/">InsideI</a>, a Ukrainian indie composer.</li>
<li><strong>Redone story, dialogue, and ending texts</strong> by Lalasa a.k.a. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lyricana">Lyricana</a>, written with Touhou canon in mind and in the style of early Touhou games. Now Marisa's and Youmu's stories differ greatly from each other, offering different facets to the game's story and a reward for playing both.</li>
<li><strong>Revamped shots, now with completely distinct playstyles</strong>. They are also updated graphically, and include new bombs and special effects. The shots may now even be considered flashier than most main series Touhou games, and offer unique ways to play the game.</li>
<li><strong>Every enemy and boss sprite is now fully animated</strong>. Enjoy fun poses during different spell cards as each character shows more personality during the fight!</li>
<li><strong>Numerous spell cards and patterns have been updated, or even outright redesigned</strong>. Some are also completely new. Taisei as an overall game is now a brand new experience that may be unrecognizable to some. The changes also extend to other parts of the game, such as an updated HUD, more Practice options, and significantly upgraded gamepad support.</li>
<li><strong>Various bugs have been discovered and squished</strong> thanks to continuous playtesting on multiple systems. Wriggle and Scuttle are fine, however, and the latter now sports a fresh appearance as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is by no means exhaustive, as many smaller and/or more technical changes have been implemented over time as well.</p>
<p>Of course, our development has not stopped here, and we have already have bold plans for the upcoming version 1.3!</p>
<p>If you like what you see from our expanded development team here at Taisei Project, remember that there's nothing stopping you from joining in and making this game even better. It could be as simple as playing the game and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/issues">reporting any issues</a>, or showcasing it to the public on social media. We still need help, and you don't need to be an expert in anything to be part of our game as long as you enjoy it as much as we do. That's why we highly encourage joining our <a class="reference external" href="https://discord.gg/JEHCMzW">Discord server</a> or <a class="reference external" href="irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/taisei-project">IRC channel</a>, where you can freely talk to the developers and other contributors.</p>

<p>Some of the notable changes are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Vertical synchronization (vsync) is now disabled by default, as it causes
percieved input latency for some players. If you'd like to use it and/or you
have screen tearing problems, you should set it to &quot;on&quot; or &quot;adaptive&quot; in the
video settings.</li>
<li>The event/input processing system has been completely rewritten, and unicode
text input now works correctly.</li>
<li>Reimplemented the framerate limiter. It's significantly more accurate now and
attempts to compensate for sudden frametime spikes. This makes the game much
more likely to run at exactly the intended speed (60 frames per second).</li>
<li>The character's Power is now also displayed as a numeric value, in addition to
the stars bar.</li>
<li>Fixed an unpleasant artifact in the boss background shader.</li>
<li>Fixed the &quot;letterboxing&quot; artifacts on some systems on non-4:3 resolutions.</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Updated the SDL game controller database. More gamepads are supported</dt>
<dd>out-of-the-box now.</dd>

</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Fixed the character getting stuck moving in some direction when using some</dt>
<dd>gamepads in the &quot;restricted&quot; axes mode.</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>Fixed memory corruption that could occur when a gamepad has less axes than
expected of an Xbox-like controller.</li>
<li>Fixed various build issues for Windows and macOS targets.</li>
<li>Updated the SDL version to 2.0.7 in the official Windows and macOS builds.</li>

<p>Roughly five years ago we had our first release and since then, we did a lot to polish the lose ends and finish where we left off.</p>
<p>The list of changes is very long, but here are some highlights:</p>
<div class="section" id="graphics">
<h2>Graphics</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Most stages got new, improved backgrounds</li>
<li>Many nice shader effects making everything look a bit more beautiful</li>
<li>A full set of character dialog graphics</li>
<li>Arbitrary resolution support!</li>
<li>Variable render quality to make taisei run smoothly on your toaster, too</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gameplay">
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Complete rebalance: Less unfair deaths, easy is now much more doable for average people</li>
<li>Extra spells: Clear all spells of a boss and you get to try a fancy new extra spell with unique mechanics for each boss</li>
<li>Spell practice</li>
<li>New shotmodes</li>
<li>Better gamepad support</li>
<li>Fully portable Replays</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resources">
<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Faster loading times due to asynchronous preloading</li>
<li>BGM support: Still lacking a soundtrack, the code is now there so you can use your own music while playing taisei.</li>
<li>File system abstraction: Technically you can make your own set of
graphics, place it in a local directory and it overwrites the
standard ones. So you can make your very own Taisei reskin about
international politics or sentient fruit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Have fun playing and let us know if you find any bugs!</p>

                <p>Spontaneous project this weekend: Making a website for the project. But soon i had to realize that something like a &quot;good CMS&quot; for my purposes does not exist. So I ended up programming my own using Go and its http capabilities. I call it &quot;GO Obviously Dreadful CMS&quot; or in short GoodCMS.</p>
<p>I generally focussed on something minimalistic and highly extensible. At the moment I have about 300 SLOC for everything here. It just reads some ini-style config data and fills the Macros in my little boilerplate file with the content from my content files, but for me it is exactly what I needed.</p>
<p>I hope this page will be a place for people to get a first impression of the project. Screenshots and poorly drawn media are to follow.</p>

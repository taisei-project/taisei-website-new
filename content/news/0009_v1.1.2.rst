Replays recorded with v1.1 and v1.1.1 should be fully compatible with this version, and vice versa.

   Implemented a more robust way to choose an appropriate SDL video driver. The

   ``TAISEI_VIDEO_DRIVER`` environment variable is now deprecated. See

   `here <https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/blob/v1.1.2/ENVIRON.md#video-and-opengl>`__

   for details.

   attempt to use the more powerful discrete GPU by default.

A few weeks later *cough* we finally are ready to present the new version 1.1.

Roughly five years ago we had our first release and since then, we did a lot to polish the lose ends and finish where we left off.

   Resources

      </p>

   -  Faster loading times due to asynchronous preloading

   -  BGM support: Still lacking a soundtrack, the code is now there so you

      .. raw:: html

         </p>

      can use your own music while playing taisei.

   -  File system abstraction: Technically you can make your own set of

      .. raw:: html

         </p>

      graphics, place it in a local directory and it overwrites the

      standard ones. So you can make your very own Taisei reskin about

      international politics or sentient fruit.

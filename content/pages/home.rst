**Taisei** *(泰西, lit. Occident)* is a free and open-source `fangame <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangame>`__ of the
`Tōhō series <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project>`__,
written in C using SDL2 and OpenGL.


Basically, it is a shoot ’em up game with lots of bullets (the genre is
literally called *bullet hell*). It doesn’t aim to rebuild a particular
installment of the Tōhō games, but is rather an original game set in the
world of Tōhō. Enjoy dodging through 6 stages full of new bullet patterns
on four difficulty levels!

If you have never played Tōhō before, you can have a look at our `manual <https://github.com/taisei-project/taisei/blob/master/doc/GAME.rst>`__ for an explanation of the controls and game mechanics.

The game is mostly done and very playable, so feel free to give it a try!
